E-EYE-O
Electronic-Early Years Educator Observations

A tracking system for recording class and student observations.

Primarily building for my own purposes but engineering for wider usage.

Will eventually be a web service + mobile apps.

Code:
You may note it seems awfully over-engineered in some places for what it is.

You would be correct.  In addition to the application itself, I am using the app as a test bed to try other new tech out.
So I want to be easily drop in/out - different dbs, nosql, different web front ends, etc.  Hence the over-engineering.
