"Milky - A free stock vector iconset"
This is another lovely set of simple but nice icons happily created by IconEden.com.
The Milky set contains more than 131 icons primarily colored in green, giving an eye-pleasant look and prominent display on either dark or bright backgrounds.
After eight times of releasing the icons seperately as each part at Min TranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s weblog, designed mostly at request by our users or readers, now we gathered and packed them all into one package, conveniently for you to get all the icons at the same time.
